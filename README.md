# BayesCoinFlips
Using Bayesian statistics to update our belief about a coin being biased or not.

## Problem Description
We have a large jar containing many coins. Half of the coins are fair and the other half are biased towards tail. 
With a biased coin, you would flip a tail in 3 out of 4 cases. We have data from 12 different experiments. In each experiment, a coin is randomly picked from the jar. That coin is then flipped 20 times. During this process we can update our belief about the coin being biased or not. We will use Bayesian statistics to determine for each coin the probability of it being biased.

## Results

In the following you can see the result of the experiment.
